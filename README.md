# RGBD-Integration:
Applying Open3D functions to integrate experimentally measured color and depth frames into a 3D object.
Data were obtained with Intel RealSense depth camera.

# List of files:
- **main__TSDF_Integrate__color_depth.py** - run this Python script to perform integration of color and depth frames from Test_data folder
- **main__TSDF_Integrate__depth_only.py** - run this Python script to perform integration of depth frames from Test_data folder

- **trajectory_io.py** - Open3D class to generate Camera poses in the necessary format
- **Test_data** - Folder with depth (and color) frames. Depth frames must be '.png' of type 'np.uint16'. 
- **expected_results** - Folder with the correct camera trajectory ('test_segm.log') and volumetric models generated by the scripts.
